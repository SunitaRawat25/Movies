Hours Per Module
********************
User Module : estimated 1 hour (including the making of basic API project)
              spent 1.5 Hour (reason of delay : was figuring out how the omdb works)
              
Admin Module : estimate 3 hour
                spent 4.5 almost (reason of delay : API key authetication took time and also configuring swagger for the same also took time)
